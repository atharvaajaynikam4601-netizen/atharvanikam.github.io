    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Mechatronics Master’s student in Germany with a strong foundation in Mechanical Engineering
      and hands-on industry experience in CAD design, FEM analysis, and industrial project execution.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have worked on special-purpose machines, hydraulic systems, tooling design, and manufacturing
      optimization projects, using tools such as <strong>CATIA V5</strong>, <strong>SolidWorks</strong>, and <strong>ANSYS</strong>.
      My work focuses on practical engineering solutions that combine design accuracy with real-world manufacturability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I am specializing in <strong>electrical drives</strong> and <strong>power electronics</strong>,
      with a strong interest in automotive systems, electrified powertrains, and sustainable engineering technologies.
